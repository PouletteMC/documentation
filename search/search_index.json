You are likely missing the 64bit version of Java. It's either not installed or needs reinstalling. Want to check if it's installed? Open a command prompt and type: java -d64 -version If it gives you an error, you don't have it installed. You can download it here (Java 8) or here (Java 11). Paper 1.17 or above requires Java 11 ( info here ). Unable to connect to the server. As the server owner, try connecting with \"localhost\" (without the \"\"). This will only work if you are hosting the server on the same computer. Works? Great! This means there is nothing wrong with the actual server. However if you want other people to be able to play on your server, you will need to port forward your ip. See section on Port forwarding . Make sure port 25565 (both TCP & UDP) is allowed through your firewall or else it will Refuse the connection. Is there a mac or linux version? No unfortunately there isn't a version for mac. Mcss is Windows only. Supported OSs : Windows Server (2008R2 SP1/2012/2016), Windows 7, 8 and 10 Is this 24/7? No, it's software that runs on your computer. Nothing like Aternos. MCSS crashes when starting it. Do you have .NET Framework 4.7.2 (or higher) installed? How do I regain control of my server if mcss crashes? To regain control of your servers you need to kill all Java processes,to do this you go to \"Quick Options\" > \"Kill all Java processes\" Warning This will kill ALL Java processes, not only mcss hosted Minecraft servers. This includes: * Minecraft instances * Any other program running Java or relying on Java to function When I start the server, it works but the performance graphs are stuck to 0% CPU and 1MB of RAM This is because you have Java 11 or higher. To fix it, you have to specify the direct path to your java binaries in mcss. 1. open the file > options menu 2. in the Global Java path override line, add the path to your java.exe (most often in C:\\Programm Files\\Java\\jdk-<version>\\bin\\java.exe ) 3. restart MCSS and try to start a server again, the graphs should display the correct information. You can also add a different Java path for some server if only one requires Java 11 or higher. To do this, stop the server, go to the servers tab and click view settings on the three dots. There, you will be able to set a local Java path, under the Advanced tab. Since v11.5.0 the process name requires a different format. This change is required, click 'Yes' to apply the change. Failed to set performance counters. Your performance counters are corrupt. Mcss can automatically do this for you. Click \"Yes\" to fix it. In case you want to do this manually: Open a command prompt with administrator rights and execute the following commands: cd c:\\windows\\system32 lodctr /R (if the lodctr command fails, simply run it twice) More info: Microsoft Support | How to manually rebuild Performance Counter Library values I have this weird IP address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, is this normal? Yes that is completely normal, that is called an IPv6 address. Most people don't have access to IPv6 yet so it's smart to share your IPv4 address instead. There are 2 versions of the IP protocol. IPv4: 192.0.2.235 IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 More info about IPv6 FUN FACT: IPv6 doesn't have port forwarding, there are no internal and external IPs. Every computer has it's own public IP. Updating from 10.4.0.0 or older fails. Due to backend api changes version 10.4.0.0 (and older) was considered End of Life (EOL) as of January 1st 2020. Update from these old builds is no longer possible, they might even break. You will need to update mcss manually. Download the latest version from the website and rename it to mcss.exe and copy'n replace it with the existing one. (make a backup just in case) When I click on start, the console remains empty and the server does nothing/Java is not installed. This is because you don't have Java installed, or it is not in the PATH variable The PATH is the system variable that your operating system uses to locate needed executables from the command line or Terminal window. First, make sure to install Java from here . I you know you already have it, try the following steps to add it to the PATH : 1. Open an explorer window. Right-click on This PC and choose Properties. 2. On the left, click the Advanced system settings link. 3. Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables, find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. If the PATH environment variable does not exist, click New. 4. In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable by adding the absolute path to you Java installation (in most cases, C:\\Program files\\Java\\jre<version>\\bin ). Click OK. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK. 5. If you were using a Command prompt window, you will need to reopen that. (The above steps were adapted from https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml ) Mcss has crashed and I want to help fix it. To help fix it, you can upload your Windows event logs and mcss logs.

The UTF-8 encoding doesn't work, I really really need it to work. The sad reality is that UTF-8 is a second-class citizen in Windows. As of Windows 10 version 1903, you have the option to set the system locale (language for non-Unicode programs) to UTF-8, but the feature is in beta. To activate it: * Run intl.cpl (which opens the regional settings in Control Panel) * Follow the instructions in the screen shot below. In some cases, the server needs to be started with additional parameters. E.g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 , this varies from the server type used. More research is required on your end. After setting this all up, this still doesn't guarantee that it will work. This just shows how bad the UTF-8 console support in Windows really is.

Troubleshooting problems and maintaining your network would be tricky and painfull. So in this guide I'll be focusing on port forwarding and the basic logic arround it. Port forwarding or port mapping isn't that difficult, it might look complicated at first but it really isn't. The pupose of port forwarding is to make a specific programs on your computer accessible to other computers on the internet. It is commonly used for hosting game servers, peer-to-peer transfers, voice-over-ip applications and much more. It isn't something you need to configure on your computer but in your modem's and/or router's web interface. In most household networks the modem contains a router with wireless capability and everything is hooked up to that. So in that case you would only need to change the settings in the modem itself. In my case, I have a modem with the wireless features turned off and I've hooked up a more powerful router to the modem. So I will need to portforward the modem and the external router. As you can see it becomes a bit confusing, if you don't know how your network is setup. Different network devices In any network you might find one of these devices: Device Description Modem This is usually provided by your internet service provider, ISP for short. Simply put: it provides a way to recieve and send data needed for your telephone, TV and internet connection. Router A device that creates a network between the computers in your home by wire or wifi. Many internet provider install modems with an built-in router. (with or without wireless capabilities) Switch Looks the same as a router but it does less. You would use a switch to expand your network, ex. 1 cable goes in, 3 cables go elsewhere. Hub Honestly, throw this thing away. Hubs are very old, they are the switches of the past. All they do is receive signals and forward them to all connected devices. They add unneeded latency and noise on the network. Just want to point out that it would be a good time to upgrade to a switch. So go ahead and look arround to see how your network is setup. Setting-up the port forwarding rule Now that you have a good sense on which router/modem you are running behind. It's finally time to connect to the machine that you want to configure. Every manufacturer has its own interface, so they all look different. Unfortunately it would be impossible for us to make a detailed tutorial on how to set up a redirect for everyone, but here is a general guide on how to port forward for a Minecraft server. Step 1 : make sure that you have a compatible router To have access to port forwarding, your internet connection must be wired (xDSL or fiber). This means that if you have a 4G/cellular router, it will be impossible for you to open a port of your network. However, there are some options to allow outside connections even if you can't portforward, like ngrok. See on their website for more infos and detailed instructions. If you have a wired internet, it is very likely that your router will support port forwarding, but it might be possible that your ISP has blocked this feature. Step 2: Find the ip of the modem/device (default gateway) Open up a command line prompt, you can do this by pressing Windows Key + R and type cmd and hit Enter . Or you can search for Command Prompt under your apps. Type ipconfig and hit Enter . This is my result, it will look different but the layout is more or less the same. What we need it the IP address of the Default Gateway . Step 3 : access the router interface Open a browser and type the address you got from the command prompte into the address bar. At this point, you will need to know the admin password of you router. If it was never changed, it might be the name/serial number of your router. Try the different numbers you can find written on your router, often on the back. If none works, you can search for the default passwords that exists by googling the model number of your router. Step 4: setting up the port forward Fisrt, check this website , they have over hundreds of tutorials for almost every brand and model. If yours isn't listed and you can't find any similar model, here are the general steps to follow : turn on the advanced mode if there is one find the settings and open the local network category find the \"port mapping\" or \"port management\" page create a new forwarding rule enter the local ip of your PC (it can be found with the same method as Step 2, just look for IPv4 address instead of default gateway) choose the TCP protocol, and set both the public/remote and private/local port to 25565 (or another port if you changed it in your server's settings) apply all the changes Once you have set the forwarding rule, you can check if it works. Make sure your Minecraft server is running and go to https://canyouseeme.org/ . Enter you public ip address and the port of your server, click the check port button. If your rule was properly setup, it should indicate that the port is open. You can now share your public ip to your friends and ask them to connect to your server with it.
